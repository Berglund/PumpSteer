# üå°Ô∏è PumpSteer Home Assistant Integration

`PumpSteer` is a custom Home Assistant integration that creates a dynamic, virtual outdoor temperature sensor. This sensor is designed to provide more intelligent control of your heat pump or boiler by adjusting the reported outdoor temperature based on several key factors: your indoor temperature, real-time and future electricity prices, optional weather forecasts, and your home's thermal inertia.

The primary goal is to optimize your home's heating for both comfort and cost-efficiency. For instance, it can "pre-boost" your heating during periods of cheap electricity or reduce heating when it's not needed, even if the actual outdoor temperature might suggest otherwise.

## Features

* **Adaptive Temperature Control:** Adjusts the virtual outdoor temperature dynamically based on the difference between your current indoor temperature and your desired target temperature.
* **Optional Pre-boost Functionality:** Proactively heats your home by setting a very low virtual outdoor temperature when cold conditions are expected *and* electricity prices are high. This feature helps to "store" heat in your home during favorable price periods.
* **Summer Mode Override:** Automatically sets a high virtual outdoor temperature to effectively turn off heating when the actual outdoor temperature exceeds a user-defined threshold, preventing unnecessary cooling or heating.
* **Aggressiveness Control:** Allows you to fine-tune how quickly and strongly th...

* Existing Home Assistant sensor entities for:
    * Your **current indoor temperature**
    * Your **current real outdoor temperature**
    * **Electricity price forecasts** (a sensor that exposes future hourly prices as a list in an attribute, typically named `today`, for example from [Nordpool](https://github.com/custom-components/nordpool) or [Tibber](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tibber/) integrations).

* You will also need the following [Home Assistant Helper entities](#helper-entities-recommended-packages-file), which are configured in your `configuration.yaml` or via the Home Assistant UI:
    * `input_number.indoor_target_temperature`: Your desired indoor temperature setting.
    * `input_number.pumpsteer_summer_threshold`: The outdoor temperature at which heating should be suppressed (summer mode).
    * `input_number.pumpsteer_aggressiveness` (Optional, Recommended): Controls the overall responsiveness of the system.
    * `input_number.house_inertia` (Optional): Allows manual adjustment or override of the calculated house inertia.

### For Pre-boost Feature (Optional)

To enable the intelligent pre-boost functionality, you must additionally provide:

* **Hourly Temperature Forecast Input (`input_text`):** This `input_text` entity must be *regularly updated* by a Home Assistant automation you create. It should contain a comma-separated string of future hourly temperature forecasts (e.g., `"2.5,3.1,4.0,..."`). You will select this entity as the **`hourly_forecast_temperatures_entity`** during configuration. # √ÑNDRAD OCH F√ñRB√ÑTTRAD BESKRIVNING
